        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>When I was five, my mother immigrated into this country with $25 to her name. She built her own catering business and everyone lent a hand to keep us afloat. I come from a world where we sleep little, leave class to go to work, and always watch out for heat strokes.</p>

        <p>I come from a very low-tech world. In 1999 my mother brought home our first computer after hearing someone was trying to get rid of it. It had a small black screen and green letters. I had fun making pictures on it using little square characters against the black background. Years later my brother got a computer for his birthday. It was a machine for MS Paint, some video games, and not much else. A few years after that, it was stolen. Beyond that computers were always something used in school.</p>

        <p>When I was 18 I was working enough to save up for a smartphone and laptop for college. I entered bottle-cap codes for Coke Rewards to get a Wired Magazine subscription to read on the train rides and bus rides to and from class. I loved reading about people slowly building a science fiction world, but never considered this was a field I could work in. I never met anyone who worked in tech.</p>

        <p>After college I got a job at a company that builds rewards websites. I answer calls from people having issues with the site. On my breaks I took courses on Khan Academy. One day Intro to Programming popped up and they had me make a sun rise out of a green field. I could not believe that is what programming was.</p>

        <p>So here we are.</p>
